# MINT: Multi-Agent Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory Generation

The code is comming soon....

### Abstract
Generating synthetic yet realistic trajectory data holds immense value for real-world applications, such as urban planning and geo-privacy protection. Prior works have regarded the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, where an intelligent agent (e.g., a human driver) controls the Markov state transition process. However, this single-agent perspective oversimplifies the urban travel environment, where multiple agents travel concurrently. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MINT (Multi-agent INteractive reinforcement learning for Trajectory generation), a novel approach that models trajectory data generation from a multi-agent perspective. By enhancing the trajectory generation model with inter-agent interaction information, MINT empowers agents to collaborate to generate more realistic trajectory data. Specifically, we design an interaction attention module, where interaction information is represented as latent vectors learned by the module. To effectively train the trajectory generation model, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. We devise the critic network that evaluates each agentâ€™s performance from both macro traffic and micro agent perspectives. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MINT generates trajectories resembling real-world behavior and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we design two additional experiment scenarios to showcase the practical applications of our work.
